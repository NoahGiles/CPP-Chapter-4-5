## C++ Chapter 4 & 5
<b>3.1.</b> Three common errors in making selection structures are using a compound condition rather than a nested one, reversing inner and outer decisions, and using an unnecessary selection structure.</br>
<b>3.2.</b> Using a compound condition makes a structure inefficient but produce the correct result. </br>
<b>3.3.</b> </br><img src="DoorFlowchart.png"> </br>
<b>3.10</b> Any program that has the function to do something more than once is hard to program without loops, as the number of times it could be played would always be limited (such as a game that asks if you would like to play again).</br>
<b>3.11</b> Using a switch statement has the benefit of not having to write a lot of if statements for similar outcomes, but has much more limiation than if else statements </br>.
<b>3.12</b> A while loop should be used over a do loop when the user has a choice to run code in the first place, as a do loop always runs the code at least once. </br>
<b>3.13</b> My favorite game in terms of the game looping is tic tac toe. The loop is a good fit because as soon as you lose you are prompted on whether or not you would like to play again.</br>
<b>3.14</b> Infinite loops are considered bad because they have no way of ending without the program stopping.</br>
